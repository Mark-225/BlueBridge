# BlueBridge

BlueBridge is a modular bridge plugin for Bukkit (or Spigot/Paper) servers with the aim to bring multiple minecraft
region plugins to BlueMap (Currently, WorldGuard and GriefPrevention are supported but there's always more on its way
and the issues are open for ideas and suggestions).

# How to use

Install BlueBridgeCore and the addons you need just like any other plugin, configure them to fit your needs and you are
ready to go!

# Download

Take a look at the [releases](https://github.com/Mark-225/BlueBridge/releases) section for direct downloads of the
plugin jar files or build the plugin yourself by cloning this repo and executing "gradlew build" from the main
directory.
